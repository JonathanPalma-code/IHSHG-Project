This project is part of the International History Students & Historians Group and Jonathan Palma. Our main goal is to protect the world of heritage and sharing/connecting between students and professionals in the fields of History, Archaeology, Speleology and Anthropology. As protection of heritage concern, we will continue to ensure the protection of the entire historical and cultural heritage of any part of the world. This website gives the possibility for any person to report a monument vicinity that is damaged, in bad condition or scheduled for destruction in real time!
